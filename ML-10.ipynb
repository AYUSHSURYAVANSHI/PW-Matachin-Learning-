    "# Answer :-\n",
    "\n",
    "# Linear regression relies on several key assumptions, and it's important to check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset to ensure the validity and reliability of the regression analysis. Here are the main assumptions of linear regression and methods to check them:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumption: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. In other words, the effect of a change in an independent variable on the dependent variable is constant.\n",
    "# Check: You can visually assess linearity by creating scatterplots of the dependent variable against each independent variable. If the points on the scatterplots form a roughly straight line, linearity is likely satisfied.\n",
    "# Independence of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumption: The errors (residuals) from the regression model should be independent of each other. There should be no systematic patterns or autocorrelation in the residuals.\n",
    "# Check: You can examine a plot of the residuals versus the order in which data points were collected to detect any patterns or trends. Additionally, you can use statistical tests for autocorrelation.\n",
    "# Homoscedasticity:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumption: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables, meaning that the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same for all values of the predictors.\n",
    "# Check: Plot the residuals against the predicted values (fitted values). If the spread of residuals remains relatively constant and does not form a funnel shape, homoscedasticity is likely met. You can also perform statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan test or White test to formally assess homoscedasticity.\n",
    "# Normality of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumption: The errors are normally distributed. This means that the residuals should follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0.\n",
    "# Check: You can create a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and look for an approximately normal distribution. You can also use statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Anderson-Darling test to assess normality.\n",
    "# No or Little Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumption: Independent variables in multiple linear regression should not be highly correlated with each other (multicollinearity). High multicollinearity can make it difficult to isolate the effect of each individual independent variable.\n",
    "# Check: Calculate correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson's correlation) between independent variables. If the correlation between any two variables is very high (close to 1 or -1), it may indicate multicollinearity. You can also use variance inflation factor (VIF) values to assess multicollinearity, with a VIF greater than 10 or 5 being a common threshold for concern.\n",
    "# To check these assumptions, it's important to use diagnostic tools and statistical tests. If the assumptions are not met, you may need to consider data transformation, adding or removing variables, or using alternative regression techniques like robust regression or generalized linear models. Additionally, when assumptions are not satisfied, it's crucial to interpret the results with caution and be aware of potential limitations in the model's accuracy."

A positive slope means that an increase in the independent variable is associated with an increase in the dependent variable, and vice versa for a negative slope.\n",
