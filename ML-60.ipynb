    "# Answer :\n",
    "# The objectives of using Selective Search in R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Region Proposal Generation:\n",
    "# Selective Search is used to generate a set of region proposals that are likely to contain objects of interest. This is done by iteratively combining smaller regions into larger ones based on their similarity in terms of color, texture, and shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Reducing the Number of Regions:\n",
    "# Selective Search helps to reduce the number of regions that need to be processed by the R-CNN, making the object detection process more efficient. By generating a smaller set of high-quality region proposals, the R-CNN can focus on the most promising regions, reducing the computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Improving Object Detection Accuracy:\n",
    "# Selective Search helps to improve object detection accuracy by generating region proposals that are more likely to contain objects. This is achieved by using a combination of bottom-up and top-down cues, such as color, texture, and shape, to identify regions that are likely to contain objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Increasing Robustness to Object Location:\n",
    "# Selective Search makes the object detection process more robust to object location by generating region proposals that are invariant to object position, scale, and orientation.\n",

    "\n",
    "# d. Pre-trained SVM models\n",

    "# 6. How Fast R-CNN is better than R-CNN.\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# Fast R-CNN is better than R-CNN in several ways. Firstly, it takes the whole image and region proposals as input in its CNN architecture in one forward propagation, which makes it computationally more efficient than R-CNN. This approach also removes the requirement to store a feature map, thus saving disk space. Additionally, Fast R-CNN uses a softmax layer instead of SVM for classification of region proposals, which has been shown to be faster and more accurate. As a result, Fast R-CNN drastically improves the training time (8.75 hrs vs 84 hrs) and detection time from R-CNN, and also marginally improves the Mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to R-CNN.\n"
