    "# The primary goal of PCA is often dimensionality reduction. Choosing a smaller number of principal components results in a lower-dimensional representation of the data.\n",
    "# The fewer principal components you choose, the more compact the representation, but at the cost of losing some detailed information present in the original data.\n",
    "# Overfitting and Underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you choose too few principal components, you might underfit the data, meaning that the reduced-dimensional representation may not capture enough of the inherent structure and variability in the data.\n",
    "# On the other hand, choosing too many principal components can lead to overfitting, where the model captures noise or idiosyncrasies in the data rather than the underlying patterns.\n",
    "# Computational Efficiency:\n",
