    "# What is Batch Normalization?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Batch normalization is a technique used in deep learning to normalize the input data for each layer. It was introduced by Ioffe and Szegedy in 2015. The main idea is to normalize the activations of each layer, which helps to reduce the internal covariate shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Internal Covariate Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "# Internal covariate shift refers to the phenomenon where the distribution of the inputs to a layer changes during training. This can happen due to the learnt representations from previous layers, which can lead to slower training and poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Batch Normalization Works\n",
    "\n",
    "# Batch normalization normalizes the activations of each layer by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each mini-batch. It also learns two learnable parameters, gamma and beta, which are used to scale and shift the normalized activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's the mathematical representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# mu = np.mean(x, axis=0)\n",
    "# sigma = np.std(x, axis=0)\n",
    "# x_normalized = (x - mu) / sigma\n",
    "# x_bn = gamma * x_normalized + beta\n",
    "# Impact on Training Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Batch normalization has several benefits that improve training performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Faster Training: Batch normalization helps to reduce the internal covariate shift, which leads to faster training.\n",
    "# Improved Stability: Normalizing the activations helps to reduce the exploding gradient problem, making the training more stable.\n",
