    "# Min-Max scaling, also known as feature scaling or normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to transform the values of numerical features within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1.

    "# If your dataset is large enough, consider using cross-validation to assess the performance of your prediction models with different numbers of principal components. This can help you choose the optimal number that balances dimensionality reduction and predictive accuracy.\n",
    "# The choice of how many principal components to retain is ultimately a trade-off between dimensionality reduction and the amount of information retained. The threshold you set for explained variance and the specific goals of your analysis will guide your decision. It's important to experiment with different numbers of principal components and evaluate their impact on your model's performance to make an informed choice."
