    "# 1. What are the different data structures used in TensorFlow? Give some examples.\n",
    "# In TensorFlow, the following data structures are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tensors: A tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numerical values. It's the fundamental data structure in TensorFlow.\n",
    "# Constants: A constant is a tensor that cannot be changed during the execution of a graph.\n",
    "# Variables: A variable is a tensor that can be changed during the execution of a graph.\n",
    "# Graphs: A graph is a collection of tensors and operations that are connected to form a computation flow.\n",
    "# Sessions: A session is an environment in which the graph is executed.\n",
    "# 2. How does the TensorFlow constant differ from a TensorFlow variable? Explain with an example.\n",
    "# A TensorFlow constant is a tensor that cannot be changed during the execution of a graph, whereas a TensorFlow variable is a tensor that can be changed during the execution of a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Create a constant\n",
    "# const = tf.constant(10)\n",

    "# 3. Describe the process of matrix addition, multiplication, and element-wise operations in TensorFlow.\n",
    "# Matrix Addition:\n",
    "\n",
    "# In TensorFlow, matrix addition is performed using the tf.add() function. This function takes two tensors as input and returns a new tensor that is the element-wise sum of the input tensors.\n",

    "\n",
    "# print(result)  # Output: [[6, 8], [10, 12]]\n",
    "# Matrix Multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "# In TensorFlow, matrix multiplication is performed using the tf.matmul() function. This function takes two tensors as input and returns a new tensor that is the matrix product of the input tensors.\n",

    "# result = tf.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# print(result)  # Output: [[19, 22], [43, 50]]\n",
    "# Element-wise Operations:\n",
    "\n",
