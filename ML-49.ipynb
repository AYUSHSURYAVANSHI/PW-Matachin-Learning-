    "# # Answer:\n",
    "# An activation function in the context of artificial neural networks is a mathematical function that is applied to the output of a node or neuron in a network. It determines the output of that node, and thereby, the overall behavior of the network. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn and represent more complex relationships between the inputs and outputs. Common examples of activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), tanh, and softmax."
