    "# Weight initialization is a crucial step in the training of artificial neural networks. The choice of initialization method can significantly impact the performance of the model. Here are some common weight initialization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Random Initialization\n",
    "# Random initialization involves assigning random values to the weights of the neural network. This method is simple to implement but can lead to poor performance due to the random nature of the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Xavier Initialization (Glorot Initialization)\n",
    "# Xavier initialization, also known as Glorot initialization, is a method that initializes the weights with a random value from a uniform distribution. The weights are scaled by a factor that depends on the number of input and output neurons.\n",

    "# Weight initialization plays a crucial role in improving convergence and avoiding vanishing/exploding gradients. Here are some ways in which weight initialization can help:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Improving Convergence\n",
    "# Weight initialization can help to improve convergence by ensuring that the weights are initialized in a region of the loss function that is conducive to convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Avoiding Vanishing Gradients\n",
    "# Weight initialization can help to avoid vanishing gradients by ensuring that the weights are initialized with a large enough magnitude to propagate gradients effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Avoiding Exploding Gradients\n",
    "# Weight initialization can help to avoid exploding gradients by ensuring that the weights are initialized with a small enough magnitude to prevent gradients from exploding.\n",
