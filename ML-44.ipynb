    "# | **Actual Negative** | False Positives (FP) | True Negatives (TN) |\n",
    "# The contingency matrix is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by providing various metrics, such as:\n",

    "# Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)\n",

    "# Recall: The proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances (TP) / (TP + FN)\n",
    "# F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall (2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall))\n",
    "# False Positive Rate: The proportion of false positives among all actual negative instances (FP) / (FP + TN)\n",
    "# True Negative Rate: The proportion of true negatives among all actual negative instances (TN) / (FP + TN)\n",
    "# By analyzing the contingency matrix, you can identify the strengths and weaknesses of your classification model, such as:\n",

    "# Entries: In a regular confusion matrix, each entry represents the number of instances predicted to belong to a particular class (row) and actually belonging to another class (column). In a pair confusion matrix, each entry represents the number of instances predicted to belong to one class (row) and actually belonging to another specific class (column).\n",
    "# Focus: A regular confusion matrix provides an overview of the model's performance across all classes. A pair confusion matrix highlights the relationships between specific pairs of classes, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the model's behavior.\n",
    "# Use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class imbalance: When dealing with class-imbalanced datasets, a pair confusion matrix can help identify which classes are being misclassified and which classes are being correctly classified.\n",
    "# Multi-class problems: In multi-class classification problems, a pair confusion matrix can provide insight into which classes are being confused with each other, helping to identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "# Error analysis: By analyzing the pair confusion matrix, you can identify specific error patterns, such as which classes are being over- or under-predicted, and adjust the model accordingly.\n",
    "# Model comparison: Pair confusion matrices can be used to compare the performance of different models on specific class pairs, helping to identify which model is better suited for a particular task.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Suppose we have a classification problem with three classes: A, B, and C. A regular confusion matrix might look like this:\n",
