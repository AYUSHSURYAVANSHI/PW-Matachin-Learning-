    "# Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label Encoding is used for categorical variables with nominal or unordered data, meaning the categories don't have any inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "# It assigns a unique integer value to each category, effectively converting them into numerical values.\n",
    "# The assignment of numerical values is arbitrary, and the algorithm might interpret these values as having some ordinal meaning if used inappropriately.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Let's say you have a \"Color\" feature with three categories: \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue.\" Label Encoding would map these categories to integers like 0, 1, and 2.\n",

    "# Ordinal Encoding is used for categorical variables with ordinal data, where the categories have a specific order or ranking.\n",

    "# Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables with an ordinal relationship into numerical values based on the target variable (the variable you are trying to predict). It's especially useful in machine learning projects where the ordinal information in the categorical feature is relevant for the predictive model. Here's how it works and when you might use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the Mean of the Target Variable for Each Category: For each category in the ordinal feature, calculate the mean (or any other appropriate measure) of the target variable within that category. This means that you are considering the average target variable value for each category.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Assign Ranks as Ordinal Encodings: Assign integer values (ranks) to the categories based on their order. The category with the lowest mean gets a rank of 1, the next category gets a rank of 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's consider a machine learning project where you are predicting the risk level of loans based on the applicant's credit score, which is an ordinal feature. The credit score categories are \"Poor,\" \"Fair,\" \"Good,\" and \"Excellent.\" You want to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to transform this feature.\n",
