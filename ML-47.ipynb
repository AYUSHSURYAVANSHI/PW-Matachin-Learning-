    "# # Answer :\n",
    "# Time-dependent seasonal components in time series analysis refer to patterns or fluctuations that occur at fixed or regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles. These components are dependent on time and are often influenced by factors like weather, holidays, or other periodic events. For example, a retail store may experience a surge in sales during the holiday season or a decrease in sales during the winter months. Time-dependent seasonal components are an essential aspect of time series analysis, as they can significantly impact the accuracy of forecasts and models."
